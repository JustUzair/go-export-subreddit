Often (but not always) a verbal or visual pun, if it elicited a snort or face palm then our community is ready to groan along with you.\n\nTo be clear, dad status is not a requirement. We're all different and excellent. Some people are born with lame jokes in their heart and so here, everyone is a dad. Some dads are wholesome, some are not.\n\nIt's about how the joke is delivered.",

And our hands were already tired.\n\nSo the doors are open. Unfortunately we are a smaller group of volunteers than most moderator teams, which means that the laudable and silly paths of going [full John Oliver](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/14bai7s/henceforth_rpics_will_feature_only_images_of_john/) or exploring other forms of \"compliance\" are not options.\n\nBeing a smaller team, we've always had a lighter touch than many other communities. This has been made possible by the good will and nature of the vast majority of r/dadjokes members... thank you for being good eggs. Flipping eggcellent even.\n\nAs this strange war-making from the platform upon the users who raised it up continues, and the tools that enable easier moderation begin to switch off (and may not be replaced), we hope that you'll have a bit of patience with us.\n\nIf you'd like to add your voice to the cause, [read this open letter](https://old.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/13xh1e7/an_open_letter_on_the_state_of_affairs_regarding/) and consider signing.\n\nP.S. Apologies if you were expecting big laughs or a hard hitting fight - no final punchline here.",
