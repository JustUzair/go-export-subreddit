We're solving a number of hard technical problems that come with syncing tens of billions of rows of data every day with perfect data integrity: building reliable \u0026amp; scalable infrastructure, making data pipelines manageable without domain expertise, and creating a UX that abstracts out the underlying complexity to let the user share or receive data. We're powering this feature at companies like LogRocket, Modern Treasury, Postscript, and Metronome.\n\nOur stack is primarily K8s/Postgres/DuckDB/Golang/React/Typsecript and we support deployments in both our public cloud as well as our customers' clouds. Due to the nature of the product, we work with nearly every data warehouse product and most of the popular RDBMSs.\n\nWe're looking for a full stack engineer who can run the gamut from CI to UI. If you are interested in scaling infrastructure, distributed systems, developer tools, or relational databases, we have a lot of greenfield projects in these domains. We want someone who can humbly, but effectively, help us keep pushing our level of engineering excellence. We're open to those who don't already know our stack, but have the talent and drive to learn.\n\n**ESTIMATED COMPENSATION:**\\- Salary range for this band is $150K to $180K- Full healthcare benefits (medical, dental, vision), modern parental leave policies, and 401(k)- Perks including CitiBike membership \u0026amp; stipend for gym membership or art classes- Company culture focused on curiosity, learning, mentorship, and ownership\n\n**REMOTE:** No, NYC only\n\n**VISA:** Yes to [TN visa](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/employment/visas-canadian-mexican-nafta-professional-workers.html)**,** otherwise, Prequel does not sponsor visas at this time\n\n**CONTACT:**  To apply -- email [jobs@prequel.co](mailto:jobs@prequel.co) and include \\[Reddit\\] in the subject line",

We\u0026amp;#39;re solving a number of hard technical problems that come with syncing tens of billions of rows of data every day with perfect data integrity: building reliable \u0026amp;amp; scalable infrastructure, making data pipelines manageable without domain expertise, and creating a UX that abstracts out the underlying complexity to let the user share or receive data. We\u0026amp;#39;re powering this feature at companies like LogRocket, Modern Treasury, Postscript, and Metronome.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Our stack is primarily K8s/Postgres/DuckDB/Golang/React/Typsecript and we support deployments in both our public cloud as well as our customers\u0026amp;#39; clouds.

That by itself is mobile development and not directly related to Go. However, I started an initiative to write a business logic layer for our mobile applications in Go using Go Mobile and update our native apps to use that library while using Swift UI and Jetpack Compose for UI over top of the Go Mobile library. The apps themselves are a mature project, but building a platform-agnostic library with Go is a greenfield effort. This role would be able to champion the project by providing technical expertise, guidance, and engineering. The team is eager but new to Go, so defining how the library goes about what it needs to do would be largely up to this person.\n\nThe role is an Engineering Manager position, and as such this person would be the quarterback of the team. You would work with product managers, solution architects, business analysts, and product owners to define and break down work for the team.

Activity feeds is very storage intensive with a fanout on read + fanout on write implementation. Video requires efficient Go code to ensure low CPU usage and low latency for video. Chat requires a good understanding of databases and denormalizing data, with some parts of chat like unread counts being storage-intensive  \n\\* At the moment we're hiring staff engineers in the EU remote as well as Amsterdam in the office.   \n\\* Candidates coming from a different language/background will also be considered. IE it's ok if you have only a bit of Go experience, but have been a backend staff level engineer or higher for years  \n\n\nEngineers at Stream tend to work very independently. More customer and product ownership compared to many other companies (our customers are engineers and product owners, so naturally engineers have more influence)  \n\n\n**Compensation**: Depends on experience, $100k-$140k  \n\n\n**How to learn more**: https://getstream.io/team/",
