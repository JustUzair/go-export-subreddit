We're solving a number of hard technical problems that come with syncing tens of billions of rows of data every day with perfect data integrity: building reliable \u0026amp; scalable infrastructure, making data pipelines manageable without domain expertise, and creating a UX that abstracts out the underlying complexity to let the user share or receive data. We're powering this feature at companies like LogRocket, Modern Treasury, Postscript, and Metronome.\n\nOur stack is primarily K8s/Postgres/DuckDB/Golang/React/Typsecript and we support deployments in both our public cloud as well as our customers' clouds. Due to the nature of the product, we work with nearly every data warehouse product and most of the popular RDBMSs.\n\nWe're looking for a full stack engineer who can run the gamut from CI to UI. If you are interested in scaling infrastructure, distributed systems, developer tools, or relational databases, we have a lot of greenfield projects in these domains. We want someone who can humbly, but effectively, help us keep pushing our level of engineering excellence.

The team we have today works best in person. Startups are hard. Early-stage startups are very hard. One of the main competitive advantages we have is speed, and given our own workstyle and skillsets, all being in the same room makes it a lot faster and easier to communicate when we need to. It's faster for us when we need to pair-program, it's faster when we need to hash out a new design or think through a bug together. Of course, this is doable in a remote setup (and some companies do it exceedingly well!), but it takes effort and intentionality to get to that point. We'd rather spend our \"effort chips\" elsewhere, especially at this stage.\n\n  \nWe're located in a large enough talent pool (NYC) that it doesn't feel like we're compromising on talent by being in person. There seems to be plenty of engineers in the broader New York area who are stellar and game to work in office.  \nThe last thing I'll note is: it also makes it easier to bond.

That by itself is mobile development and not directly related to Go. However, I started an initiative to write a business logic layer for our mobile applications in Go using Go Mobile and update our native apps to use that library while using Swift UI and Jetpack Compose for UI over top of the Go Mobile library. The apps themselves are a mature project, but building a platform-agnostic library with Go is a greenfield effort. This role would be able to champion the project by providing technical expertise, guidance, and engineering. The team is eager but new to Go, so defining how the library goes about what it needs to do would be largely up to this person.\n\nThe role is an Engineering Manager position, and as such this person would be the quarterback of the team. You would work with product managers, solution architects, business analysts, and product owners to define and break down work for the team. While we are just starting to look at using Go, this role has the opportunity to make it a more central focus for themselves and the rest of the mobile team. Passport does expect Engineering Managers to be able to be hands on as time permits.\n\n**LOCATION:** Charlotte, NC\n\n**REMOTE:** Yes.

Im writing code along with reading. Im almost at the bottom of parser. I understood Lexer, Tokenizer, AST like it was nothing. But parser... oh man I don't understand sh*t. The author did a great job explaining everything. But when I get everything around my head, wake up the next day and boom, I forgot everything. Im not sure if its because the parser part is hardest or im just way too dumb to understand. Im thinking about finishing the book, playing with the codebase for few days trying to implement new features and revise the parser part. I really love the book and want to get the best out of it. Didn't touch evaluation part yet, so im not sure if its even harder or not.\n\nNote: I have just finished high school and didn't get into college yet so I had no knowledge over how interpreter works in general.",
