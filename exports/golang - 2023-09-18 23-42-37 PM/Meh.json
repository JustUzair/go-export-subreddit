            "selftext": "I currently have to read from a MongoDB instance and had to find out that there are lots of data inconsistencies.  \nNot a nice situation and in the long term we have to clean it up and fix the \"producers\" (which are written in PHP). But for the moment I sadly have to deal with it.\n\nExample: a document contains a field `tags` which SHOULD look like this:\n```json\n{\n    \"tags\": [\n        0: {...},\n        1: {...},\n        2: {...}\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nAnd I read that into:\n```json\ntype MyDocument struct {\n    Tags []Tag `bson:\"tags\"`\n}\n```\n\nA former PHP dev used array operations that remove array elements by key while keeping the remaining keys, so naturally, when JSON encoded, `tags` are converted from array to object. Result is that in some documents we see this instead:\n\n```json  \n{  \n    \"tags\": {         \u0026lt;- tags is now an object\n        0: {...},     \u0026lt;- because the key '1' is missing\n        2: {...}  \n    }  \n}  \n```\n\nFurthermore, `tags` can sometimes be missing, can be `null` and also can be an empty JSON object `{}`.\n\nSo when the go mongodb driver unmarshalls the data into my strict struct, it fails.\n\n**Question:** Is there any better possibility than setting the type of `tags` in my struct to `interface{}` and type switching later on?",
