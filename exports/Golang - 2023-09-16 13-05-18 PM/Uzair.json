However, when I try to use it on my Windows system, it throws an error, stating 'undefined: syscall.Kill.' After some investigation, I've learned that this method doesn't work on Windows.\n\nI'd like to ask for alternatives or suggestions on how to achieve similar functionality on a Windows platform. Your insights and recommendations would be greatly appreciated! Thank you in advance.",
