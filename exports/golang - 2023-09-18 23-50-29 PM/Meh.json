The role is for a backfill for myself as a [Software Engineering Manager, Mobile](https://workforcenow.adp.com/mascsr/default/mdf/recruitment/recruitment.html?cid=defb40d0-f2ac-46a8-a5c8-84f563616cc8\u0026amp;ccId=19000101_000001\u0026amp;jobId=474315\u0026amp;lang=en_US). That by itself is mobile development and not directly related to Go. However, I started an initiative to write a business logic layer for our mobile applications in Go using Go Mobile and update our native apps to use that library while using Swift UI and Jetpack Compose for UI over top of the Go Mobile library. The apps themselves are a mature project, but building a platform-agnostic library with Go is a greenfield effort. This role would be able to champion the project by providing technical expertise, guidance, and engineering. The team is eager but new to Go, so defining how the library goes about what it needs to do would be largely up to this person.\n\nThe role is an Engineering Manager position, and as such this person would be the quarterback of the team. You would work with product managers, solution architects, business analysts, and product owners to define and break down work for the team. While we are just starting to look at using Go, this role has the opportunity to make it a more central focus for themselves and the rest of the mobile team. Passport does expect Engineering Managers to be able to be hands on as time permits.\n\n**LOCATION:** Charlotte, NC\n\n**REMOTE:** Yes. As far as I know, there are no time zone requirements, but I believe current employees are either in the USA or India.\n\n**VISA:** Passport does not sponsor visas at this time\n\n**CONTACT:** Please apply directly on the [careers page](https://workforcenow.adp.com/mascsr/default/mdf/recruitment/recruitment.html?cid=defb40d0-f2ac-46a8-a5c8-84f563616cc8\u0026amp;ccId=19000101_000001\u0026amp;jobId=474315\u0026amp;lang=en_US)",

We do this for thousands of apps and over a billion end users. 4-5 years ago we switched from Python to Go and everything (other than ML) runs on Go, RocksDB, Raft, Redis, and CockroachDB/Postgres.  \n\n\nA few highlights:  \n\\* High traffic environment, focus on scalability  \n\\* 3 different products, each with their unique challenges. Activity feeds is very storage intensive with a fanout on read + fanout on write implementation. Video requires efficient Go code to ensure low CPU usage and low latency for video. Chat requires a good understanding of databases and denormalizing data, with some parts of chat like unread counts being storage-intensive  \n\\* At the moment we're hiring staff engineers in the EU remote as well as Amsterdam in the office.   \n\\* Candidates coming from a different language/background will also be considered. IE it's ok if you have only a bit of Go experience, but have been a backend staff level engineer or higher for years  \n\n\nEngineers at Stream tend to work very independently.

But for the moment I sadly have to deal with it.\n\nExample: a document contains a field `tags` which SHOULD look like this:\n```json\n{\n    \"tags\": [\n        0: {...},\n        1: {...},\n        2: {...}\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nAnd I read that into:\n```json\ntype MyDocument struct {\n    Tags []Tag `bson:\"tags\"`\n}\n```\n\nA former PHP dev used array operations that remove array elements by key while keeping the remaining keys, so naturally, when JSON encoded, `tags` are converted from array to object. Result is that in some documents we see this instead:\n\n```json  \n{  \n    \"tags\": {         \u0026lt;- tags is now an object\n        0: {...},     \u0026lt;- because the key '1' is missing\n        2: {...}  \n    }  \n}  \n```\n\nFurthermore, `tags` can sometimes be missing, can be `null` and also can be an empty JSON object `{}`.\n\nSo when the go mongodb driver unmarshalls the data into my strict struct, it fails.\n\n**Question:** Is there any better possibility than setting the type of `tags` in my struct to `interface{}` and type switching later on?",
