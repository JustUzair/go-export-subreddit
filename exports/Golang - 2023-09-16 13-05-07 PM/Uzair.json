            "selftext": "Hello everyone. I've been writing Go for over 1.5 years now (Non professionally. For my side projects only). Ive started reading \"writing an interpreter in Go\". Im writing code along with reading. Im almost at the bottom of parser. I understood Lexer, Tokenizer, AST like it was nothing. But parser... oh man I don't understand sh*t. The author did a great job explaining everything. But when I get everything around my head, wake up the next day and boom, I forgot everything. Im not sure if its because the parser part is hardest or im just way too dumb to understand. Im thinking about finishing the book, playing with the codebase for few days trying to implement new features and revise the parser part. I really love the book and want to get the best out of it. Didn't touch evaluation part yet, so im not sure if its even harder or not.\n\nNote: I have just finished high school and didn't get into college yet so I had no knowledge over how interpreter works in general.",
